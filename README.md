  The project I was working on was a scenario in which I was a junior developer at Chada Tech. They wanted me to work on a project that involved working on building an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. 
I was meant to build a program that could analyze text records from what they generated throughout the day. 
  I feel like I was able to build a program that worked sufficiently and was able to do exactly what was meant to happen, so I feel very strongly about that. I could have maybe simplified the task a little bit. 
  I think to enhance my program, I could simplify it. I could create code that didn't take as long to type out. In this manner, not only would I have not had to work as long, but the user might understand the program
better, too. 
  I find that most of the program was difficult to create. I was able to overcome this by just working diligently and never giving up. I'd use a lot of online resources and Youtube tutorials in order to learn more, 
and I'm thinking about going to tutoring moving foward. 
  I think all of the skills that I've been learning are going to be transferrable. I've found that a lot of what I'm learning in C++ is also used in Python and Java, as well. 
  I was able to make this program maintainable and adaptable by using the resources that I found to make sure that I was working the problem that had been presented to me correctly.
